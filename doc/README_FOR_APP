Notes for authorisation



Query format
============

	<service>:<resource>:<hyperlink>:<verb>:<app>:<context>

A complete authorisation request to get individual Text resources from all apps and contexts
might look like this:

	https://api.example.com/authentications/4Lp6hdZ99jtCpU9yx3N5zBaljmQ?query=cms:texts:self:GET:*:*
                                                                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Default authorisation components
================================

Action		hyperlink	verb
----------	---------	----
index		self		GET*
show		self		GET
create		self		POST
update 		self		PUT		
destroy		self		DELETE

connect		connect		PUT
disconnect	connect		DELETE


The hyperlinks "creator" and "updater" can't be restricted specifically for each resource, since
they result in ApiUser GET accesses. The client either has GET access to ApiUsers or not, no matter
how the hyperlink is obtained (self, creator, updater, whatever). It is of course quite possible to
restrict access to ApiUsers to a specific app and context.




Containment chain for Rights
============================

A Role has many Rights

A Group has many Rights 
        and many Roles which each have many Rights

An ApiUser has many Roles which have many Rights,
           and many Groups which have many Rights,
                                  and many Roles which each have many Rights.
